# Welcome to Help

### What is help?
Help is an online tool to either find help, or help others. For example, if you are really good with back end, you can navigate to the [search page](https://help.sojs.repl.co/search), type in ["back end" and "back-end"](https://help.sojs.repl.co/search?q='back%20end'+back-end), and quickly find people who need help with back-end. 
### How * Help search * Works
The search works as follows:
When you post something to Help, you provide tags. Tags are one of the most important parts to a Help post. Without them, you will always be last in search results. 
Lets say that there are three posts:
- one with the tag of "back-end", "python".
- one with the tags of "dev", "back-end", and "servers"
- one last with "HTML", and "front-end"
If you search (either at "/pleas" or "/search" - it does not matter, you will be routed to the same search URL) for "back-end" and "servers" you will get the results as follows:
1. one with the tags of "dev", "back-end", and "servers"
2. another with the tag of "back-end", "python".
3. one last with "HTML", and "front-end"
The results that are not relevant
